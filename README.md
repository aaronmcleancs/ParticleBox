Performant Computing Particle Simulation

Multithreaded particle simulation written in C++ using SDL2. Simulates basic physics interactions between thousands of particles.

Features

Spatial Partitioning
Replaced brute-force O(NÂ²) collision checks with a partitioned grid.

Multithreading
Divided the particle set into chunks processed in parallel using threads.

Memory Management & Random Generation
Pre-allocated particle storage and replaced rand() with modern, thread-local rngs.
